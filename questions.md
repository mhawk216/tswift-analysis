Hello Team!

Taylor Swift has become one of the biggest pop stars in the world. She recently began her ‘Eras Tour’, her first tour since 2018! As a result, Taylor Swift and her music has become a frequent topic in the office as there are many Swifties employed here. Some of these conversations have resulted in heated and lengthy debates surrounding Taylor Swift's music and which songs and albums are most popular. I am hoping you could use this Spotify dataset of songs from Taylor Swift’s studio 9 albums to answer the questions below and help settle some of these office debates. 

**1.** During what time span, did Taylor’s songs reached peak popularity? When did her songs reach lowest popularity?  
**2.** Songs like All Too Well (the 10 minute version) are quite popular with many of her fans. Many of the office Swifties love Tayor Swift because of her song story-telling abilities; this often results in songs which are longer in length. Please describe the relationship between song duration and popularity.  
**3.** Some critics have argued that Taylor Swift’s popularity has increased since her transition from the country to pop music genre, does the data support this? There is a divide among office Swifties about which genre resulted in more popular music. Is Taylor’s most popular music from a the country or pop (or alternative) genre?  
**4.** Overall, what attribute(s) makes for the most popular and least popular Taylor Swift music?

I look forward to hearing back from you and seeing what you come up with! 
Best,

Your Database Team Leader
